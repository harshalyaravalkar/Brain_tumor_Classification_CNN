# Brain_tumor_Classification_CNN
This repo has Brain Tumor Classification project, where we leverage the power of deep learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately diagnose brain tumors from MRI scans. This application, seamlessly deployed using Flask, offers a user-friendly interface for uploading and predicting tumor types in real-time.

## Project Structure

- `CNN project.ipynb/`: Contains the Jupyter notebook used for developing and training the CNN model.
- `code_py.py`: The main Flask application script.
- `templates/`: Directory for HTML templates.
    - `CNN_deploy.html`: HTML file for uploading images.
    - `pred.html`: HTML file for displaying predictions.
- `Brain_tumor_classification.h5`: The trained CNN model.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- TensorFlow
- Flask
- OpenCV
- PIL (Pillow)
- NumPy
